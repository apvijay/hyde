## Journals
1. Vijay Rengarajan, A.N.Rajagopalan, R.Aravind, and Guna Seetharaman, "Image Registration and Change Detection under Rolling Shutter Motion Blur," IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), November 2016 [\[Paper\]](../pdf/2016_tpami.pdf)

## Top Conferences
*The top three computer vision conferences (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV) are highly competitive with acceptance rates about 20-25%: CVPR and ICCV have CiteSeer impact factor rankings in the top 5%, ECCV in the top 7%, of all computer science journals and conferences.*
