I am a Ph.D. student at IIT Madras. I work on the study of camera motion in rolling shutter cameras with Prof. [A.N.Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju) and [Prof. R.Aravind](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/user/aravind/). 

##Research problems

###Rolling Shutter Cameras

**Single Image Rectificaion** Correcting rolling shutter effect from videos are addressed in most works, while this work tackles the challenging problem of rolling shutter correction from __only__ a single image.

**Super-resolution** Unlike classical super-resolution techniques which assume global camera pose change between low-resolution images, this work registers rolling shutter distorted low-resolution images row-wise in a subpixel manner and produces a distortion-free high-resolution image.

**Image Registration and Change Detection** This is a seminal work in the row-wise image registration in the presence of  both rolling shutter and motion blur artifacts. In addition, any changes between the images are also jointly estimated. The method is extremely useful in drone imaging that employs CMOS sensors.
