I am a Ph.D. student at IIT Madras. I work on the study of camera motion in rolling shutter cameras with Prof. [A.N.Rajagopalan](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju) and [Prof. R.Aravind](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/user/aravind/). 

##Research problems

###Rolling Shutter Cameras
Most cameras today use CMOS sensors, almost all of which employ an electronic rolling shutter mechanism. The image exposure is not one-shot-global but row-wise. This mechanism affects traditional geometry approaches while working with such cameras. Any camera motion during exposure causes distortions even _within_ an image. What you see with your human eyes is not what you get. Such distortions (skew, wobble, curvature) are named as the _rolling shutter effect_.

**Single Image Rectification** Correcting rolling shutter effect from videos are addressed in most works in literature, while this work tackles the challenging problem of rolling shutter correction from _only_ a single image. The challenges are to (i) identify and extract distorted information, (ii) exploit that information to estimate camera motion, and (iii) correcting the image using the motion.

**Super-resolution** Unlike classical super-resolution techniques which assume global camera pose change between low-resolution images, this work registers rolling shutter distorted low-resolution images row-wise in a subpixel manner and produces a distortion-free high-resolution image.

**Image Registration and Change Detection** This is a seminal work in the row-wise image registration in the presence of  both rolling shutter and motion blur artifacts. In addition, any changes between the images are also jointly estimated. The method is extremely useful in _drone imaging_ that employs CMOS sensors.

###Global Shutter Cameras

**Large-image Motion Blur Registration** Change detection is an important task in aerial imagery in which environmental changes and new/lost/modified objects in the scene are detected by imaging from aircrafts over different periods of time. In such a scenario, registering large images both geometrically and photometrically in the presence of viewpoint change and motion blur is a challenging task. This work estimates camera pose differences between two large images quickly by using only a _subimage_ of the whole image.

###Single Pixel Cameras

**Camera Motion Estimation** A single pixel camera records a limited number of linear combinations of the scene with random images. Camera motion dusing such an acquistion would be devastating during reconstruction or any scene inference from those compressively sensed measurements. This work estimates the camera motion difference between two such sensed measurements without actual image reconstruction.
