title: Rolling Shutter Rectification
---

## Abstract
The rule of perspectivity that ‘straight-lines-must-
remain-straight’ is easily inflected in CMOS cameras by
distortions introduced by motion. Lines can be rendered
as curves due to the row-wise exposure mechanism known
as rolling shutter (RS). We solve the problem of correcting
distortions arising from handheld cameras due to RS effect
from a single image free from motion blur with special relevance 
to urban scenes. We develop a procedure to extract
prominent curves from the RS image since this is essential
for deciphering the varying row-wise motion. We pose an
optimization problem with line desirability costs based on
straightness, angle, and length, to resolve the geometric
ambiguities while estimating the camera motion based on a
rotation-only model assuming known camera intrinsic matrix. 
Finally, we rectify the RS image based on the estimated
camera trajectory using inverse mapping. We show rectification 
results for RS images captured using mobile phone
cameras. We also compare our single image method against
existing video and nonblind RS rectification methods that
typically require multiple images.

## Results
Given a single RS image, we detect curves and estimate the row-wise camera motion modelled as a polynomial that would make them straight under angle and length constraints. Finally, the RS image is rectifed using the estimated motion.
