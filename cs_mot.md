title: Compressed Sensing Motion Estimation
---

## Abstract
Temporal artifacts due to sequential acquisition of measurements
in compressed sensing manifest differently from a conventional optical
camera. We propose a framework for dynamic scenes to estimate the
relative global motion between camera and scene from measurements
acquired using a compressed sensing camera. We follow an adaptive
block approach where the resolution of the estimated motion path
depends on the motion trajectory. To underline the importance of the
proposed motion estimation framework, we develop a face recognition
algorithm in the compressive sensing domain by factoring in the
time-varying nature of the acquisition process.
